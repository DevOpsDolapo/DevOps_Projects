The LEMP Stack is one of the most popular Technology Stacks used in the development of software, applications, and websites. A great working knowledge of this Web Stack is an essential addition to a DevOps Engineer's skill set.

The term Technology Stack was defined in the previous project, but here is a quick recap:

What is a Technology Stack?

A technology stack is a set of tools and frameworks used to build or develop software products. They are specifically used together in the creation of functional software or applications. These technology stacks are named using the acronyms of the individual technologies involved in developing a particular product.

Examples of technology stacks are:

- LEMP (Linux, NginX, MySQL, PHP (or Python or Perl))

- LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP (or Python or Perl))

- MERN (MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJS)

- MEAN (MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS, NodeJS)

## Introduction to LEMP Stack Architecture

The LEMP stack is made up of Linux OS, Nginx Server, MySQL Database, and PHP. Its components are also all open-source just like the LAMP stack and is used to create dynamic web applications.

The acronym LEMP can be broken down as follows:

- L (Linux operating system)
Linux is an open-source operating system. In this case the webserver runs on the Linux operating system.

- E (Nginx web server)
This is pronounced as “Engine X”. It is a very popular web server. While it is open source just like Apache, it is faster in certain situations and comes with better security.

- M (MySQL database server)
A SQL-based relational database system.

- P (PHP)
PHP is a server-side scripting language that communicates with the database and server.
