## AWS Networking Implementation (VPC, Subnets, IG, NAT, Routing)

AWS networking uses Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) and subnets to create the backbone of cloud-based projects. In the AWS networking implementation project, complex aspects of AWS networking will be simplified, while the useful and adaptable nature of VPCs and subnets will be highlighted. This project will help DevOps Engineers understand VPCs and subnets better by taking us on an interesting trip to discover how to fully use AWS networking and make the most of cloud-based projects.

The aim of this project is for the student to Master the art of AWS Networking Implementation, including VPC, subnets, internet gateways, NAT, and routing, thereby providing the necessary skills to design and deploy scalable and secure cloud architectures.

The project will be covering the following key areas:

- What is an Amazon VPC?

- Creating and Configuring Subnets

- Understanding Public and Private Subnets in AWS VPC - Internet Gateway and Routing Table

- Introduction to Private Subnets and NAT Gateway

- Understanding the Differences between Security Groups and Network Access Control Lists

- VPC Peering and VPN Connection
