## AWS Networking Implementation (VPC, Subnets, IG, NAT, Routing)

AWS networking uses Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) and subnets to create the backbone of cloud-based projects. In the AWS networking implementation project, complex aspects of AWS networking will be simplified, while the useful and adaptable nature of VPCs and subnets will be highlighted. This project will help DevOps Engineers understand VPCs and subnets better by taking us on an interesting trip to discover how to fully use AWS networking and make the most of cloud-based projects.

The aim of this project is for the student to Master the art of AWS Networking Implementation, including VPC, subnets, internet gateways, NAT, and routing, thereby providing the necessary skills to design and deploy scalable and secure cloud architectures.

The project will be covering the following key areas:

- What is an Amazon VPC?

- Internet Gateway and Routing Table

- NAT Gateway and Private Subnets

- Security Group and Network ACLs

- VPC Peering and VPN Connection
