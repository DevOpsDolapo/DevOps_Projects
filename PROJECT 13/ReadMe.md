## Ansible Dynamic Assignments (Include) and Community Roles

The last two (2) projects equipped us with Ansible knowledge and skills to perform configurations using playbooks, imports, and roles. In this project, we'll continue configuring the UAT servers from Project 12, learning and practicing new Ansible concepts and modules along the way.

The aim of this project is to unleash the flexibility of Ansible with dynamic assignments (include) and community roles, increasing automation capabilities and leveraging pre-built solutions.

In this project, we'll be;

- Introducing dynamic assignment into our structure

- Updating site.yml with dynamic assignments
