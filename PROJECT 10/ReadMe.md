## Implementing a DevOps Tooling Website Solution

The aim of this project is to build a comprehensive DevOps tooling website solution using a 3-tier architecture like we did in the last project. We'll be exploring the integration of various tools and technologies to create a unified platform to aid effective collaboration, automation, and efficiency between the software development and operations teams.
