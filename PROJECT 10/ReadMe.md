## Implementing a DevOps Tooling Website Solution

The aim of this project is to build a comprehensive DevOps tooling website solution using a 3-tier architecture like we did in the last project. 

We'll be exploring the integration of various tools and technologies to create a unified platform that can aid effective collaboration, automation, and efficiency between the software development and operations teams.

**Note**: Just like in the last project, this project was meant to be implemented using Amazon AWS EC2 instances. However, due to the cost implications of running the project on AWS with the attendant cost of the extra storage volumes, I decided to implement the project using Oracle VirtualBox Virtual Machines.
