## Implementing Ansible Refactoring and Static Assignments

The Ansible Refactoring and Static Assignments project continues from where we left off in Project 11. In this project, we'll continue working with the `ansible-config-mgt` repository and make some improvements to our code. 

The aim of the project is to learn how to refactor Ansible code, create assignments, and use the imports functionality. Imports allow us to effectively re-use previously created playbooks in a new playbook, so we can organize our tasks and reuse them when required.

This project will cover the following:

- Improving Jenkins Pipeline To make it Neater
- Refactoring Ansible Code by Importing other Playbooks
- Configuring UAT Webservers with a Role Webserver
- Referencing Webserver role
- Committing and Testing
