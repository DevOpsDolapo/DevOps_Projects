## Implementing Ansible Configuration Management: Ansible-Automate Project

This project aims to give us a better appreciation of DevOps tools by using Ansible Configuration Management to automate a lot of our routine tasks.

For this project, our architecture will include a Jump Server (Bastion Host), which is essentially a client-server architecture that separates the user interface (presentation layer), application processing (application layer), and data management (data layer) into three distinct tiers or layers.
