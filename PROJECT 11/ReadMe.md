## Ansible Configuration Management: Ansible-Automate Project

The aim of this project is to automate our processes from Project 7 to 10 where we manually performed a lot of processes and configurations such as setting up virtual servers, installing and configuring required software, and deploying a web application. We'll also be writing a bit of code using a declarative language such as `YAML`.

**Note**: Just like in previous projects, this project was meant to be implemented using Amazon AWS EC2 instances. However, to save cost, I'll be implementing the project using Oracle VirtualBox Virtual Machines.

This project will cover the following:

- Installing and Configuring a Jenkins/Ansible Server

- Preparing a Development Environment using Visual Studio Code

- Carrying Out Ansible Development

- Setting Up and Ansible Inventory

- Creating a Common Playbook

- Updating GIT with the Latest Code

- Running Ansible Tests
