## What is Git?

Git is a Version Control or Source Control System. Its main benefit is that it provides a solution to the problem of keeping track of the changes software developers make to source code. It also ensures that source code is shared efficiently.

Git is popularly used in software development, however, before the advent of Git, developers used other Source Control Systems such as SVN. The problem with SVN is that it runs on a central repository which makes it difficult for multiple developers to make changes to code at the same time as changes could only be made one after the other. Besides, anytime SVN's central repository goes down, it becomes unavailable thereby stopping developers from working.

However, Git is a distributed system, so it enhances collaboration between developers by allowing them make their own version or copy of the central repository.
