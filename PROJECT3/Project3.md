There are different technology stacks used in the development of various solutions such as software, applications, websites, etc. These technology stacks are known as Web Stacks and they include the LAMP, LEMP, MERN, and MEAN stacks. As a DevOps Engineer, it is important to have a good knowledge and understanding of how to implement these technology stacks.

What is a Technology Stack?

A technology stack is a set of tools and frameworks used to build or develop software products. They are specifically used together in the creation of functional software or applications. These technology stacks are named using the acronyms of the individual technologies involved in developing a particular product.

Examples of technology stacks are:

- LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP (or Python or Perl))

- LEMP (Linux, NginX, MySQL, PHP (or Python or Perl))

- MERN (MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJS)

- MEAN (MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS, NodeJS)

## Introduction to LAMP Stack Architecture

The LAMP stack consists of four (4) different software technologies that developers use to build web applications and websites. The LAMP stack is quite popular among developers because all four technologies are open source; they are maintained by a community and freely available for everyone to use. They are free of cost, easy to use, easy to maintain, and flexible.

The LAMP architecture is great for creating, hosting, and maintaining web content.

The acronym LAMP can be broken down as follows:

- L (Linux operating system)

- A (Apache web server)

- M (MySQL database server)

- P (PHP programming language)

## Setting up an AWS Account

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a cloud services provider that facilitates on-demand delivery of IT resources over the internet through a pay-as-you-go pricing template.

For this project, I'll be using free-tier servers on the AWS platform known as EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) running on the Ubuntu Server OS.
