## Implementing WordPress Website With LVM Storage Management

This project is aimed at building and managing a scalable WordPress website on a 3-tier architecture using Oracle VirtualBox and LVM (Logical Volume Management) storage. It is aimed at enhancing the skills needed for the deployment and maintenance of a robust WordPress site on the AWS cloud platform.

**Note:** This project was meant to be implemented using Amazon AWS EC2 instances. However, due to the cost implications of running the project on AWS with the attendant cost of the extra storage volumes, I decided to implement the project using Oracle VirtualBox Virtual Machines. 

The project will cover the following:

- Configuring a Database Server and Implementing LVM Storage Subsystem on It

- Configuring a Web Server and Implementing LVM Storage Subsystem on It

- Installing WordPress on the Web Server

- Installing MySQL on the Web Server and Database Server

- Configuring the Connection Between the Database and WordPress

- Configuring the Web Server to Connect to the Database Server
