# Documentation for the Linux Practice Projects

## This project aims to help the student gain valuable experience working with Linux commands in the Linux terminal

#### Task 1 - sudo 

The **sudo** command lets you perform tasks requiring administrative or root permissions.

Command: **sudo apt upgrade**

Being the first time running the **sudo apt upgrade** command on the Linux machine, it upgraded the operating system packages and libraries.

*Below is a screenshot showing the command and the start of the upgrade process:*
