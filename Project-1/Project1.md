# Documentation for the Linux Practice Projects

## This project aims to help the student gain valuable experience working with Linux commands in the Linux terminal

### Task 1 - sudo 

The **sudo** command lets you perform tasks requiring administrative or root permissions.

Command: **sudo apt upgrade**

Being the first time running the **sudo apt upgrade** command on the Linux machine, it upgraded the operating system packages and libraries.

*Below is a screenshot showing the command and the start of the upgrade process:*

### Task 2 - pwd (present working directory)

The **pwd** command shows the full path of a user's current working directory.

*The picture below shows the outcome of running the command when a user is in the Desktop directory:*

### Task 3 - cd (change directory)

The **cd** command allows you to navigate through linux directories (folders)

The pictures below show the results of running the cd command to switch between different directories

*The outcome of changing directory to the commandslinux directory:*

### Task 4 - ls (list)

The ls command is used to list files and directories within the system

The **ls** command can also be used with flags to specify certain options and outcomes from our results.

*The **ls -a** (using the -a flag) command allows us to see visible and hidden files/folders in any directory. In Linux, hiddens files and folders are denoted by a .(dot) preceeding the file or folder name:*

*The **ls -lh** (using the -lh flag) command shows files and directories listed in a human-readable format along with their sizes:*
