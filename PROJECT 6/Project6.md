## Documentation for Understanding Client-Server Architecture with MYSQL as RDBMS

Client-Server architecture refers to a model where two or more computers are connected together over a network to send and receive requests (information or data) between one another. 

Each machine in a Client-Server architecture has its own role during communications with the machine sending requests known as the "Client" and the machine responding to those requests (serving the requests) is known as the "Server".
