# Documentation for Understanding Client-Server Architecture with MYSQL as RDBMS

Client-Server architecture refers to a model where two or more computers are connected together over a network to send and receive requests (information or data) between one another. 

During communications, each machine in a Client-Server architecture has its own role with the machine sending requests known as the "Client" and the machine responding to those requests (serving the requests) is known as the "Server".

## Understanding Client-Server architecture

Basically, in a client-server architecture, the client sends a request for data, while the server accepts and serves the request, sending the data back in the form of packets to the user who has requested them.
