# Automating Load Balancer Configuration with Shell Scripting

Load balancing automation involves using scripts or software tools to create, update, monitor, and delete load balancers along with their associated rules and policies. 

Automating the load balancer configuration can lead to a reduction in human intervention, help cut out configuration mistakes, and aid adjustment to changing traffic patterns and server conditions.

Some of the benefits of load balancing automation are:

- Improves server administration

- Saves time and resources

- Enhances reliability and security

- Improves scalability and flexibility

- Optimizes performance and availability

## Automating the Deployment of Servers

In the previous project (Project 7), we implemented two Apache backend servers with an Nginx load balancer distributing traffic between both servers. The whole process in Project 7 was done manually. However, for this project we'll be automating the process from start to finish.
